Recent advancements in large-scale foundation models have expanded generative AI's influence from static content creation to dynamic, interactive applications, with gaming as a prominent domain. This note introduces a novel genre termed \emph{Generative Games}, which incorporates generative AI as a foundational mechanic. It begins by tracing the evolution of generative AI applications in games, then identifies three key features of generative games as real-time interactive scenarios, personalized and dynamic storylines, and autonomous, self-evolving character behaviors. Finally, it envisions a future where games drive advancements toward AGI and evolve beyond entertainment to support self-actualization.
